Sal	Paracelsys, how is your mission going? You came back from Magus faster than I thought you would...	Neutral
Paracelsys	I sa--	Happy
Paracelsys	I uh... its going well.	Neutral
Sal	What's wrong?	Neutral
Paracelsys	Umm, nothing... just thinking is all.	Neutral
Paracelsys	It's a little bit sad how some people think that they can't survive traveling between Cion and Magus, huh...	Neutral
Paracelsys	Is that part of the reason why so many want to keep the worlds split?	Neutral
Sal	That's part of the reason.	Neutral
Sal	It is human nature to fear the unknown. This is why me must show them what they do not know, even if we must do so by force	Neutral
Paracelsys	I understand. Its honestly just hard to imagine a life where I'd be trapped in one place forever...	Sad
Sal	Neither could I...	Neutral
Sal	Regardless, you must remained focused on your mission. You must slay the mantis and retrieve it's heart.	Neutral
Sal	Goodluck.	Neutral
