Paracelsys	Huff, huff...	Sad
Paracelsys	Was that good enough?!	Neutral
The Queen	You passed.	Neutral
Paracelsys	!	Happy
The Queen	...But.	Neutral
The Queen	You won't just be fighting Cion soldiers. You still have to pass the test course for the Magus soldiers and environment	Neutral
The Queen	Be careful. The power that you manifest in here so far have been teleportation and poison gas, and teleportation would be fata in a real fight if you use it at the wrong time	Neutral
The Queen	I've lost enough men already to the strange powers of the Magus side, so stay on your toes	Neutral
Paracelsys	Don't worry! I'll make sure to be cautious with it.	Angry
Paracelsys	...Do you really think we'd be able to unite Magus and Cion	Happy
The Queen	Of course!	Neutral
The Queen	Let's make things the way that they're supposed to be.	Neutral
