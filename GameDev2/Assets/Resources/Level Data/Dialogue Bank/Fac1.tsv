Paracelsys	Whoa. Is this some kind of factory?	Neutral
Sal	Precisely. The largest industrial factory in Cion, to be more precise	Neutral
Paracelsys	Alright. What do I need?	Angry
Sal	There is a large mantis-like Cion soldier in one of these rooms.	Neutral
Sal	I need you to fetch its heart. 	Neutral
Paracelsys	What's so special about this heart?	Neutral
Sal	You will find out in due time. For now, I need you to follow orders like the obedient soldier you are.	Neutral
Sal	However, in one of these rooms is a portal I opened to the Magus Castle. You'll need to acquire spells from there to have a chance at defeating the Mantis. 	Neutral
Sal	I would have liked to teleport you straight from the Alchemist Hideout, but the Magus wizards have been blocking every portal I create.	Neutral
Paracelsys	...why must they oppose us? Are they aware that we want to help them??	Sad
Sal	Magus and Cion have hated each other since their inceptions. 	Neutral
Sal	The Magus people fear the progression of Cion's technology, and the Cion people see Magus as primitive. These mindsets have lead to constant fighting and war that persists as we speak.	Neutral
Sal	So that's why it up to us, the Alchemist, to help them see the wrong in their ways. We will unite these people and bring peace to our world.	Neutral
Paracelsys	OF COURSE! I will do everything in my power to save this world! Your wish is my command.	Angry
Sal	Exactly.	Neutral
Sal	Good luck, Paracelsys	Neutral
