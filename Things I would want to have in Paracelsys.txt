Things I would want to have in Paracelsys
-----------------------------------------

Shop system for the static upgrades
Pickup cutscenes/static images
Better minimap, which tracks visited sections
More levels, space out cutscenes
	Final rush level
More simple power ups
	Bonus airdashes
	Extra damage
Redesign some sections of the current levels to better include some power ups
Make the progression more free form
Visual changes that make the game look more polished
Double check the enemies and make sure they all have proper settings
Original music

Known issues/bugs:
Potential softlock in factory 2 caused by picking up the key to the second factory and getting stuck without anti-grav/powerswap/drill
**Issue with respawning in the final boss fight more than once causes the boss to be stuck in dialogue
**Weird gravity issue when getting hit from above/below in the air
Reflect doesn't always work for some reason
	**No idea why this is happening, may just make the wall itself thinner to look more correct visually
Clipping with certain walls needs to be cleaned up for teleport
**Teleporting up/down should be easier
**Shooting/Player direction needs to be handled better

"If traction were doubled and the collision hitboxes were smaller than it'd turn out a lot slicker"
"Get rid of the run button/run and just make it the default speed"
Clean up collision boxes a lot
